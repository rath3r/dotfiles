# Dotfiles

This is my perferred inital setup. 

## What's in it

Here is a list of things I like to have:

### Tmux

My choice of multiplexer. I'm currently trying TPM as a package manager.

#### Installation

`sudo apt install tmux`

#### Usage

Tmux uses a "prefix" to provide access tmux controls. I use the default which is <C-b> (Ctrl+b)
